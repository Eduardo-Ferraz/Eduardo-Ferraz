🚀 About Me

I'm a Web Developer and Computer Science student at UFES (Brazil) driven by a purpose: to change people's lives on a large scale through technology.

I have a background in Electrical Engineering and a thirst for continuous learning, always seeking high-impact environments to grow and contribute. My experience spans from leading development teams to building secure, scalable full-stack applications. I am currently focused on microservice architectures, cloud-native solutions, and AI integration.

🇧🇷 Based in: Vitoria, Espírito Santo, Brazil

🎓 Studying Computer Science at the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES).

💬 Languages: Portuguese (Native) | English (Fluent) | German (Basic)

💡 What I'm Currently Focused On

My recent work involves solving complex problems in a fast-paced internship environment:

Microservice Architecture: Actively contributing to the migration of a monolithic application to microservices, defining standards for MVC patterns and unit tests.

AI Integration: Developing a new microservice for AI-powered essay evaluation using the Gemini and ChatGPT APIs.

Cloud & DevOps: Building and managing serverless schedules and functions with AWS Lambda and EventBridge.

Application Security: Hardening application security by identifying vulnerabilities (PenTests) and implementing robust countermeasures, including Rate-Limiting, CSP, reCAPTCHA v2/v3, and JWT Refresh Tokens.

QA & Testing: Managing and improving automated E2E test suites with Cypress.
